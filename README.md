# FrozenDict

- Behaves in most ways like a regular dictionary, except that it's immutable, TRULY immutable.
- Most implementations of FrozenDict simply subclass dict, or wrap a thin object around one.
- This implemtation does the wrapping at the C level, making it impossible to change from Python.
- Use it like a regular dictionary, such as in this example:

``` python
from frozen_dict import FrozenDict
f = FrozenDict({'x':3, 'y': 4, 'z': 5})
```

### Features
- Hashable like a tuple.  It returns a hash if and only if its values are hashable.
- Works with both Python 2 and Python3.
- Supports bi-directional conversion to and from regular dictionaries
- A FrozenDict is created with the same arguments that instantiate a regular dict.

### Speed
- Lookup times are O(1)
- Just as fast as regular dictionaries.  40 - 60 nanoseconds per lookup.
- Designed to store keyword arguments for memoized function calls.
- 40% Faster to compare two FrozenDicts than two corresponding frozensets.

### Memory
- Uses 50-60 more bytes than would be required with a regular dictionary.

### Hash Algorithm
- Hashes a frozenset of the dictionary items, with the key-value tuples reversed
- The hash calculation is deferred until needed and then cached, like a string.
- The Items view of a frozen dict hashes and compares equal with a frozenet.

``` python
def __hash__(self):
    if self.h == -1:
        pairs = ((self[k],k) for k in self)
        self.h = hash(frozenset(pairs))
        self.h ^= maxsize
        if self.h == -1:
            self.h = -2
    return self.h
```

### Recursion:
- A frozen dict is not recursive by default, but an auxilary function "freeze" does do it.
- "freeze" turns unhashable objects into generic python immutable types
- sequences such as lists become tuples
- unordered collections such as sets become frozenset
- mappings such as dictionaries become FrozenDict instances

``` python
 [in] >>> from deep_freeze import freeze
 [in] >>> dct = {'x': 3, 'y': 4, 'z': {'a': 0, 'b': [3,1,{4,1},[5,9]]}}
 [in] >>> frz = freeze(dct)
 [in] >>> print(frz)
[out] >>> FrozenDict({'y': 4, 'x': 3, 'z': FrozenDict({'a': 0, 'b': (3, 1, frozenset([1, 4]), (5, 9))})})
```
